# Mine

Currently only one mine per resource allowed.

Beside the common parameters from [Map Object Format](../Map_Object_Format.md) there are some additional parameters:

```json
{
	/// produced resource
	"resource" : "mithril",

	/// amount of resources produced each day
	"defaultQuantity" : 1,

	/// displayed name of mine
	"name" : "name text",

	/// displayed description of mine (for popup)
	"description" : "description text",

	/// Image showed on kingdom overview (animation; only frame 0 displayed)
	"kingdomOverviewImage" : "image.def"
}
```
